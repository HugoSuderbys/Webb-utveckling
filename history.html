    <h1>The Early Years: 1973 - 1981</h1>
    <div class="early">
      <p>
        Since the dawn of time, the human race has been a competitive one. The
        hunger for victory has led to races on foot, by horse and by boat. When
        the first automobile was invented in the late 18th century, things were
        no different. Motorsport enthusiasts had been competing in rallies
        around the world for a number of years, but at the time there was no
        platform for manufacturers and teams to really test themselves under a
        championship. So, after increased demand, the FIA World Rally
        Championship was born in 1973. Kicking off with Rallye Monte-Carlo,
        crews faced thirteen mammoth-length international events in a true test
        of man and machine. Renault was crowned inaugural World Rally Champions
        after its Alpine A110 dominated at the hands of drivers including
        Jean-Claude Andruet, Jean-Pierre Nicolas and Jean-Luc Thérier. Despite
        its infancy, the WRC in the 1970s was a magical spectacle for teams,
        drivers and fans alike. It was during this era that we saw some of the
        most evocative rally cars of all time. From Italy, Lancia kicked off its
        illustrious association with rallying with the beautiful Stratos model
        which was campaigned by drivers including Sandro Munari and Markku Alén.
        Aside from its futuristic looks, the unforgettable scream produced by
        the V6-engined machine made it somewhat unique in comparison to the
        other saloon cars competing at the time. Around the same time, Ford
        entered the sport with what has arguably gone on to become the most
        successful rally car of all time: the Ford Escort RS. Rally legends
        including Hannu Mikkola, Björn Waldegård Ari Vatanen and Roger Clark all
        helped to take the World Rally Championship to a new level with their
        popular ‘sideways’ driving style.

    <h1>Group B 4WD: 1982 - 1986</h1>
    <div class="gb">
      <img src="History/Quattro.jpg" alt="Bild på den berömda Audi Quattro" />
      <p>
        As the World Rally Championship rolled into the 1980s, the
        rear-wheel-drive cars such as the Ford Escorts, Fiat 131s and Lancia
        Stratos were pushed aside to make way for a new era: Group B. Group B
        welcomed some of the most spectacular rally cars the world had ever
        seen, boasting four-wheel-drive and in some cases over 500 brake
        horsepower. Sources at the time claimed that a Group B car could
        accelerate from 0-60mph (96km/h) on a gravel road in just 2.3 seconds.
        Although the FIA had made four-wheel-drive legal back in 1979, many
        manufacturers assumed that it was simply too complicated and would not
        be competitive. However, in 1982, Audi wheeled out its brand-new Quattro
        and enjoyed immediate success. The extra power from its turbocharged
        engine in addition to the traction gained from its four-wheel-drive
        system were clear advantages. As a result, the German firm enjoyed
        success with Manufacturers’ titles in ‘82 and ‘84 as well as Drivers’
        titles in ‘83 and ‘84 at the hands of Hannu Mikkola and Stig Blomqvist
        respectively. As other manufacturers cottoned on to the Quattro’s
        success, the fight for the World Rally Championship became even more
        heated. Ari Vatanen was a force to be reckoned with during the 1985
        season and looked set to take the spoils in his flame-spitting Peugeot
        205 T16. However, a terrifying incident during Rally Argentina caused
        the Finn some serious injuries, essentially handing the victory to his
        teammate Timo Salonen as Vatanen recovered on the sidelines. The battle
        resumed in 1986 and a long list of rallying royalty took to the stages
        across the globe. Names including Toivonen (Lancia), Alén (Lancia),
        Röhrl (Audi), Salonen (Peugeot) and Pond (MG) all set out to challenge
        for the title. Lancia edged an early lead at the beginning of the season
        thanks to strong performances in Monte Carlo and Sweden from their
        drivers Toivonen & Alén. At the third round in Portugal, the Italian
        firm looked strong once more as they held a 1-2-3 after stage 3.
        However, disaster struck when the Ford RS200 of Joaquim Santos lost
        control during the next speed test and collided with a crowd, killing
        three and injuring over 30 spectators. As a result, many of the teams
        withdrew from the remainder of the event. Toivonen was victorious once
        again in Italy and asserted his dominance as the title favourite. But,
        at the following round in Corsica, the World Rally Championship was
        turned on its head. During the 17th stage of the event, Toivonen’s
        Lancia Delta S4 left the road and plunged down a mountainside before
        bursting into flames. He and his co-driver Sergio Cresta were killed
        instantly. Following on from the tragedy, the FIA announced that it
        would ban Group B cars after the end of the season, deeming them simply
        too fast to compete safely. At the end of the era the results from the
        San Remo Rally were declared void, leaving Juha Kankkunen to take the
        crown with his Peugeot.

    <h1>Group A: 1987 - 1996</h1>
    <div class="ga">

      <p>
        With Group B now outlawed, the FIA needed to introduce a new class
        structure for the 1987 season onwards. The answer? Group A. In
        comparison to Group B, the Group A regulations meant that all of the
        vehicles competing were strictly based on their production counterparts,
        with limitations on aspects such as power, weight and aerodynamics.
        These restrictions also helped to bring down the overall cost to
        manufacturers and encouraged more privateer teams to enter the rallies.
        Of course, with new regulations came brand-new rally cars and vehicles
        including the Lancia Delta Integrale, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Ford
        Escort Cosworth and Toyota Celica GT-Four all graced the stages.
        Building on the success that they enjoyed with the Delta S4 Group B car,
        the Lancia marque was once again quick out of the blocks and were
        seemingly unbeatable with their new Delta Integrale. The team dominated
        the Manufacturers’ points right through until 1992, taking the
        prestigious title an incredible six years on the trot. Juha Kankunnen
        and Miki Biasion also enjoyed their share of success with the car,
        claiming the Drivers’ championship victory two times each during the
        era. As the World Rally Championship headed into the 1990s, Japanese
        manufacturers Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota all changed up a gear and
        showed impressive pace. Spanish hero Carlos Sainz topped the leaderboard
        in the Drivers’ championship in 1990 and 1992 in his Toyota Celica
        GT-Four, whilst Juha Kankunnen did the same on his debut year with the
        team in 1993, taking his fourth championship victory and bringing Toyota
        their first Manufacturers’ world title in the process. The Group A era
        also saw a fresh crop of talent making their first foray into the world
        stage. A young Colin McRae was contracted to the Subaru team for the
        1992 season and he immediately impressed onlookers with his flamboyant
        driving style. Despite having limited experience of rallying’s top
        flight, the Scot chalked up fifth position in his debut year and also
        claimed his maiden WRC victory at Rothmans Rally New Zealand. McRae’s
        hard work paid off in 1995 when he sealed the championship in Britain
        after an intense battle with teammate Carlos Sainz. After working his
        way up the ranks on the British and European rallying scene, the late
        Richard Burns also made his factory WRC debut at the Network Q RAC Rally
        in 1993. Burns brought his Subaru Legacy RS home in seventh place and
        went on to enjoy several further outings before moving to Mitsubishi in
        1996. For the remainder of the 1990s, the World Rally Championship
        continued to be dominated by Japanese protagonists Subaru and
        Mitsubishi. Subaru took the Manufacturers’ title in 1996 with the
        Impreza 555 before a change in regulations made way for the next
        generation of world rally cars.

        The 1997 World Rally Championship brought with it a series of major
        changes. Group A cars were replaced by World Rally Cars, which took the
        pressure off the manufacturers as they were no longer required to
        mass-produce the production versions of the cars with which they
        competed. The revamp made it much easier for new manufacturers to join
        the series and the next few years saw increased interest and entries
        from teams such as Seat, Citroën, Peugeot and Hyundai. In addition to
        new technical regulations, the new era saw an updated events system.
        Rallies became more compact in comparison to the long marathon-style
        events that crews were faced with beforehand, but the calendar was
        extended to include 14 rallies throughout the year across the world.
        Whilst the majority of the manufacturers worked hard to build and
        develop their new world rally cars, Mitsubishi decided to take a
        different approach. Their Lancer Evolution was already a successful
        package and bore a close resemblance to the road-going model, which was
        good for sales. Because of this, the Japanese firm continued to enter
        its cars in Group A specification. With Tommi Mäkinen at the wheel,
        Mitsubishi proved that their car was still one of the best, bringing
        home another Manufacturer’s’ title in 1998 whilst the Finn won the
        Drivers’ championship three years in a row between 1997 and 1999
        following a series of hotly contested battles. Around that time, their
        closest challenger was British-based M-Sport Ford World Rally Team,
        which had employed McRae to pilot its Ford Focus. In 2000, another Finn
        drove his way into the history books. Marcus Grönholm took his first
        world championship title driving a Peugeot 206. The French firm enjoyed
        a dream return to the sport’s top-flight as it also lifted the
        Manufacturers’ for the next three seasons. British driver Burns took a
        hugely popular championship victory in 2001 with his Subaru Impreza, but
        Grönholm responded by taking back the title the year after. In 2003,
        Norwegian legend Petter Solberg reigned victorious, but Citroën was
        Manufacturers’ champions thanks to some spirited performances from Sainz
        and a young Sébastien Loeb. Who would have known that the French hotshot
        would go on to dominate the series for the next decade? Loeb was
        unbeatable on every surface and gave Citroën three Manufacturers’ world
        titles in a row. Despite Ford claiming the Manufacturers’ victories in
        2006 and 2007, Loeb managed to retain control of his own titles. Along
        with co-driver Daniel Elena, he wrote his name into the rallying record
        books with a whopping nine Drivers’ World Championship wins at the wheel
        of the Xsara, C4 and DS3 models. Loeb’s retirement from full-time
        driving at the end of the 2012 season marked the end of the most
        successful reign in the history of the World Rally Championship. So, who
        was his successor? Well, he was French, and also called Sébastien!
        Sébastien Ogier had also learned his craft at the wheel of a Citroën as
        a teammate to Loeb in 2011. However, the Frenchman later announced a new
        contract with German marque Volkswagen and piloted their Polo R WRC from
        2013 onwards. In a similar way the Loeb and Citroën had dominated, Ogier
        took Volkswagen to consecutive Manufacturers’ and Drivers’ titles
        between 2013 and 2016. After wrapping his fourth championship victory at
        the end of 2016, Volkswagen announced their withdrawal from the World
        Rally Championship with immediate effect. With new regulations imminent,
        Ogier was left to find a new seat for the 2017 season

      <p>
        The 2017 season marked the 45th anniversary of the FIA World Rally
        Championship, kicking off once again with the classic Rallye Monte
        Carlo. Revised technical regulations meant that the new generation of
        World Rally Cars boasted increased levels of engine power, more
        aggressive aerodynamics, and electronically controlled differentials. Of
        course, more power results in faster cars, but the improved aerodynamics
        and suspension make a current generation World Rally Car much safer to
        drive than a Group B equivalent from the 1980s. The biggest news, aside
        from the newly-implemented technical changes, was that Sébastien Ogier
        and co-driver Julien Ingrassia signed a new contract with M-Sport Ford
        World Rally Team. The French pair teamed up with Estonia’s Ott Tänak and
        Welsh wizard Elfyn Evans in the new Ford Fiesta. Hyundai entered its New
        Generation i20 Coupe model at the hands of title favourite Thierry
        Neuville, the ever-reliable Dani Sordo and Hayden Paddon, whilst Toyota
        made a welcome return to the championship after an 18-year sabbatical.
        Under the Tommi Mäkinen managed Toyota Gazoo Racing banner, it fielded
        Jari-Matti Latvala, Juha Hänninen and Esapekka Lappi in its Yaris.
        Citroën also opted for a full championship assault following a part-time
        campaign the previous year. Kris Meeke, Craig Breen, Stefane Lefebvre
        and Andreas Mikkelsen throughout the year in their C3 model. Ogier and
        Ingrassia immediately picked up from where they left off at Volkswagen,
        taking another world title and scoring another Manufacturers’ victory
        for the M-Sport outfit. Tänak was third and moved to Toyota for 2018. An
        intense battle in 2018 saw Ogier, Neuville and Tänak head to the final
        round in Australia with a mathematical chance of championship victory.
        Neuville’s hopes were dashed when his Hyundai clipped a bank on the
        final day and lost a wheel. Elsewhere, Tänak’s Toyota succumbed to
        transmission failure which inevitably handed Ogier and the M-Sport Ford
        Team yet another World Championship victory. So, as the 2019 season
        kicked off, the World Rally Championship had yet to see a non-French
        driver lift the coveted title in over a decade. Despite a successful two
        years at M-Sport, Sébastien Ogier’s contract with the team had run out.
        Citroën were quick to snap him up with hopes of taking back the
        Manufacturers’ title once again. Esapekka Lappi drove the second C3 for
        the French team. However, Citroën’s dreams of success didn’t come to
        fruition. Whilst Ogier was able to bring home victories in Monte Carlo,
        Mexico and Turkey, the reigning champ struggled throughout the year with
        the handling characteristics of his C3. Neuville topped the timesheets
        in Corsica, Argentina and Spain in his Hyundai, but there was one man
        that nobody could catch. Tänak was unassailable in his Toyota Yaris,
        taking 73 stage wins throughout the year and six rally victories across
        all surfaces. He and Martin Järveoja sealed the deal in Spain and
        finally took their maiden World Rally Championship title - ending the
        ‘Seb’ domination. Neuville was a distant second and Ogier had to settle
        for the final step on the podium.
