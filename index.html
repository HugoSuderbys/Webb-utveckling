            McRae was born in Lanark, Scotland, to Jimmy and Margaret McRae.
            Jimmy McRae was the five-time winner of the British Rally
            Championship. McRae was the eldest of three brothers; his middle
            sibling, Alister McRae, is also a rally car driver. McRae's maternal
            uncle Hugh "Shug" Steele was also a former rally driver. He attended
            Underbank Primary School in Carluke.

            McRae was married to Alison (nee Hamilton), whom he met aged 19 when
            she acted as his co-driver, and had two children, Hollie and Johnny.
            McRae moved to the principality of Monaco in 1995, partly through
            his friendship with David Coulthard. However, as his young family
            grew up, he spent more time back at his home in Lanarkshire. The
            couple bought the 17th century Jerviswood House. McRae's nephew, Max
            McRae, is also a motorsport racer.
