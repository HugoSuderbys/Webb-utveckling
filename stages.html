          The most unpredictable rally of the year. Relatively straight-forward
          asphalt roads in the French Alps are complicated by winter weather
          which places an emphasis on cunning tyre choices. Little is simple in
          the high mountains!

      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/finlandflagga.png" alt="finlands flagga" />
        <p>
          WRC newcomer which ventures deep into the frozen and remote Arctic
          Circle in northern Finland, where temperatures are extreme and
          daylight hours are short. Studded tyres provide remarkable grip in the
          snow. Paradoxically, it is one of the season’s fastest rounds.
        </p>

      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/kroatienflagga.png" alt="kroatiens flagga" />
        <p>
          Debut WRC appearance for Croatia. A tantalising mix of asphalt, with
          some surfaces worn and bumpy due to weather and water damage and
          others much smoother. Generally fast roads, but very narrow in parts.
          Springtime will display Croatia’s beautiful countryside in all its
          glory.

        <img src="länderbilder/portugalfalgga.png" alt="Portugals flagga" />
        <p>
          One of the oldest and most popular rounds of the WRC. Fast and
          technical gravel roads inland from Porto in the north and centre of
          the country are soft and sandy initially, but can become rocky and
          rutted for the second pass. Plenty of tricky corners hidden by crests
          while temperatures can soar in Portugal’s early summer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/italiensflagga.png" alt="Italiens flagga" />
        <p>
          Rugged and sun-baked gravel tracks in the north of the picture
          postcard Mediterranean island ensure one of the season’s sternest
          challenges. Fast and narrow stages leave no margin for error, while
          intense heat combines with abrasive roads to test tyres to the limit.
        </p>

          The WRC returns to Africa for the first time since 2002. The Safari of
          old has evolved to fit the modern-day WRC, but its character remains
          with challenging closed dirt roads, stunning picture-postcard scenery
          and exotic wildlife. Competitors can expect rocky and rutted tracks
          and unpredictable weather which could transform dry and dusty trails
          into glutinous mudbaths.

      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/estlandflagga.png" alt="Estlands flagga" />
        <p>
          Full-length event after short format rally restarted WRC last year
          following a pandemic-instigated calendar reshuffle. Fast gravel roads
          with plenty of crests and jumps are paired with more technical
          sections on wide and narrow forest roads. The biggest motorsport event
          in the Baltic countries.
        </p>

      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/belgienflagga.png" alt="Belgiens flagga" />
        <p>
          First WRC appearance for Belgium – the 35th nation to stage a round.
          Narrow and twisty asphalt farm lanes are lined by drainage ditches and
          telegraph poles, with many tight junctions. Big cuts in corners mean
          mud and debris are dragged onto the road, making conditions slippery.
          Compact route with little time to pause for breath.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/greklandsflagga.png" alt="Greklands flagga" />
        <p>
          A legendary WRC fixture which returns to the championship for the
          first time since 2013. Twisty rocky mountain roads combine with high
          temperatures and choking dust to provide a fierce challenge. The
          tracks are smoother than they used to be but still pose punishing
          demands on tyres and cars.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/finlandflagga.png" alt="Finlands flagga" />
        <p>
          Smooth and blisteringly quick gravel roads, buried among forests and
          lakes, are characterised by massive stomach-churning jumps. The
          fastest rally in the championship and the one that every driver wants
          to win. Bravery and commitment are essential here more than anywhere
          else.
        </p>

      <div class="two-column">
        <img src="länderbilder/spanienflagga.png" alt="Spaniens flagga" />
        <p>
          After many years as the championship’s only mixed surface encounter,
          Spain’s fixture switches to sealed-surface roads only. Fast and smooth
          circuit-like asphalt in the Costa Daurada hills down the coast from
          Barcelona encourages attacking driving and judicious corner-cutting
          saves vital tenths. Keeping things neat and tidy is key.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second WRC appearance as a late addition to the calendar. Stages at
          Monza’s historic Temple of Speed circuit feature smooth race track,
          flat-out curves on the restored banked oval and tricky mixed surface
          service roads. Away from the circuit, technical mountain roads near
          Bergamo, in the foothills of the Italian Alps, are fiendishly
          difficult.
