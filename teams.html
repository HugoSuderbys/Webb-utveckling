          The Korean firm wasn’t new to the WRC. It competed in the F2 category
          between 1998 and 2000, before switching to a World Rally Car version of
          its Accent saloon until 2003. Hyundai’s return was heralded by the
          unveiling of a prototype i20 World Rally Car at the Paris Motor Show in
          September 2012. Things moved quickly, with the establishment three
          months later of a new motorsport base in Germany. Former Peugeot WRC
          technical head Michel Nandan was brought in to oversee the task of
          creating a fully operational team, a rally-specification i20 and
          developing a brand new motorsport facility - all from scratch and in 12
          months. At the wheel throughout 2014 was the previous year’s
          championship runner-up, Thierry Neuville. Hyundai was clear from the off
          that the season would be a development year, but it showed plenty of
          promise and Neuville led a surprise 1-2 result in Germany. The team’s
          breakthrough came in 2016 when Neuville firstly put the i20 on the
          podium at Rallye Monte-Carlo and then Hayden Paddon’s dominant maiden
          victory in Argentina made people sit up and take note. Neuville matched
          the performance two rallies later in Sardinia and after two victories
          and 12 podiums, Hyundai secured second in the championship. There was a common theme to 2017 and 2018. Neuville and Hyundai led both
          championships before fading away in the second half of the season and
          having to settle for more runners-up finishes. The squad rang the changes
          for 2019. Andrea Adamo took over as team principal and nine-time champion
          Sébastien Loeb joined Neuville, Andreas Mikkelsen and Dani Sordo at the
          wheel. A steely strategic approach was rewarded with its first
          manufacturers’ title. Newly-crowned world champion Ott Tänak made a shock
          switch to the Korean squad for 2020 and Hyundai squeezed home at the final
          round to secure back-to-back successes. Tänak and Neuville lead the 2021
          attack, with Dani Sordo and Craig Breen sharing the third car.

          Established by ex-factory team driver Malcolm Wilson, M-Sport was
          selected to breathe new life into Ford’s World Rally Championship
          programme in 1997. Former world champions such as Colin McRae, Carlos
          Sainz and Marcus Grönholm delivered numerous rally victories, the latter
          leading the squad to back-to-back manufacturers’ titles in 2006 and 2007
          with a Focus RS World Rally Car. Jari-Matti Latvala and Mikko Hirvonen
          brought more victories when the Fiesta replaced the Focus in 2011, but
          Ford’s withdrawal from the championship at the end of 2012 delivered a
          financial blow to Wilson’s small team. It toiled without further success
          until 2017 when the arrival of Sébastien Ogier signaled a swift upturn
          in fortunes. The Frenchman led the team to both the drivers’ and
          manufacturers’ world titles in an impressive new-generation Fiesta. Ford
          returned to M-Sport’s side in 2018 in greater force and Ogier delivered
          another drivers’ crown before returning to Citroën in 2019. There’s a
          youthful look to the 2021 squad. Twenty-four-year-old Gus Greensmith
          tackles his first full season in a Fiesta World Rally Car. He is joined
          by Teemu Suninen, 26, and rising French star Adrian Fourmaux, 25, who
          share a second Fiesta.

          The Japanese brand can trace its rally roots back to 1957 when it
          entered the Mobilgas Round Australia Rally. But it was 1975 when Toyota
          really made its mark, when Hannu Mikkola won Finland’s 1000 Lakes Rally
          at the wheel of a factory-backed Corolla. Toyota established a
          motorsport base in Cologne, Germany, and went on to claim more WRC
          victories, including three consecutive Safari Rally wins. In 1990,
          Toyota had its first WRC champion driver in Carlos Sainz, and in 1993 it
          became the first Japanese brand to win the WRC manufacturers’ title. By
          the end of its factory-backed activities in 1999, Toyota had collected
          three manufacturers’ titles, (in 1993, 1994 and 1999) and four drivers’
          titles (two for Sainz and one each for Juha Kankkunen and Didier
          Auriol). Toyota’s return was confirmed in January 2015 by the company’s
          president, and passionate rally enthusiast, Akio Toyoda. A team base was
          established in Finland and Toyoda put former world champion Tommi
          Mäkinen in charge of developing a Yaris ready for a 2017 comeback. The
          squad proved the surprise of the season. A sensational second place for
          Latvala at the opening Rallye Monte-Carlo could have been dismissed as a
          fluke – before he followed it with victory at the next round in Sweden.
          Esapekka Lappi added a third win at the fastest rally of them all, Neste
          Rally Finland. The success continued as new signing Ott Tänak joined
          Latvala and Lappi and the trio lifted the manufacturers’ title in 2018.
          Twelve months later Tänak secured his maiden drivers’ crown. The team
          had an all-new line-up in 2020, featuring Sébastien Ogier, Elfyn Evans
          and rookie Kalle Rovanperä. In a compelling season finale, Ogier
          overcame Evans to claim his seventh drivers’ title and Toyota has
          retained the same line-up for 2021.

          French team 2C Compétition was only formed in 2009 but has taken huge
          steps in just a few years to reach the very top level of the WRC.
          Champions on both gravel and asphalt in France and double champions in
          Belgium, the squad’s biggest success came in 2019 when Pierre-Louis
          Loubet won the WRC2 world title in a Skoda Fabia. Loubet moved into the
          WRC’s top tier the following season as 2C Compétition prepared a Hyundai
          i20 World Rally Car for the young Corsican. The partnership continues
          into 2021 as Loubet contests a full campaign for the first time.
